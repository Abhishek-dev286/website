+Title = Platform Support

Below is a table of platforms that are supported by Azul3D *today*. More will be added in the future, if you wish to see a new one here please [create an issue](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues).</p>

| Operation System | Version                  | Architectures | Graphics Hardware       |
|------------------|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Windows          | XP and higher            | 386, amd64    | OpenGL 2+ hardware [1]  |
